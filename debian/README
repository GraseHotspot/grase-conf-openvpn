The Debian Package grase-conf-openvpn
----------------------------

This package installs a config file for OpenVPN to allow it to connect to the
"master" server for remote assistance. Initially it generates a new private key
and certificate signing request and uploads the csr to the master server for
signing. Daily it will check for a signed certificate and download that if it
exists. Failing that, it will reupload the csr to the master server.
